## Southeast Asia Infrastructure Risk Prototype

This prototype tool presents infrastructure risk analytics for South-East Asia
(SEA) using open-data sources on fluvial and coastal flooding hazard maps along
with cyclone hazard maps. The risks are analysed and visualised for power
plants, electricity transmission lines, road networks, railway networks, ports
and airports, using our peer-reviewed risk analysis methodologies.
