A new paper published in the journal Global Environmental Change has quantified benefits of adaptation for infrastructure in Ghana. The project assembled a national geodatabase for the country â€“ a first for the country. This database was then analysed using a systems-based modelling approach to quantify adaptation needs for infrastructure services. Next three strategies were developed for adaptation investment provision and tested, including quantification of benefits and co-benefits. 

The research was co-authored by OIA experts and contributes towards a larger project that is funded by the Global Centre on Adaptation (GCA), United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), United nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Government of Ghana.
