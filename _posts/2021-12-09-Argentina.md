In collaboration with the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) OIA experts have recently published a novel study that quantifies freight adaptation benefits in Argentina. OIAâ€™s unique system-based data and tools, were used to estimate direct and indirect macroeconomic losses resulting from transport disruptions, particularly flood-related risks.

The report provides a baseline to compare adaptation interventions and prioritise those with the highest benefit to cost ratio (BCR). Infrastructure elements where the avoided direct and indirect losses of failure are highest, in comparison to the cost of upgrading interventions, should be prioritised.
