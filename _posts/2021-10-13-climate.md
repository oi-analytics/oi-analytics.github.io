Published ahead of COP26, this new report highlights the key role that infrastructure plays in delivering climate action and sustainable development. Developed through collaboration between UNOPS, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and OIA experts based in the University of Oxford, it finds that infrastructure is responsible for 79 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions, and accounts for 88 per cent of all adaptation costs.

Despite recognition of the need for action, policy makers face challenges in understanding where resources should be allocated, and which practical actions should be prioritized, to maximize progress. Through a systematic assessment of global research, this report offers new insights to help address this challenge.
