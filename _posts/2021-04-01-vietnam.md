Assembling complex datasets and utilising our unique systems-based approach, we have undertaken a flood risk assessment for multi-scale transport system in Vietnam. This study was conducted at two scales, national and provincial. The national analysis covered estimating economic impacts of freight disruption on key national-scale roads, railways, civil aviation, inland waterways, and maritime systems that make up Vietnam’s multimodal transportation infrastructure. The province-scale analysis involved estimating the economic impacts of lack of access to roads between key locations within communities in three specific provinces. A novel adaptation analysis created in the study explored the measures intended to improve the structural reliability of road assets to make them more resistant to climate change impacts. The effectiveness of adaptation options for a particular road asset were quantified through a cost-benefit analysis by comparing the investment costs of the options with the benefits of avoided risks.

The project was developed with the World Bank and was supported by the Ministry of Transport in Vietnam. The report made recommendations to the Ministry of Transport on the scientific evidence required to develop a national strategy for climate resilient transport and plans—as part of the transport sector’s contribution to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—to meet the Paris Climate Agreement targets.
