Working in collaboration with the government of the State of Qatar, OIA has undertaken the design of the first national infrastructure systems model for the country: NISMOD-Q. The first-of-its-kind tool for the region embeds two main areas of functionality to support strategic decision making within Qatar: i) Infrastructure service demand and capacity planning; and ii) Infrastructure risk and adaptation planning.
