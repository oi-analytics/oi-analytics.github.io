Through a 2-day interactive workshop, OIA experts have supported infrastructure and climate action changemakers from multiple African countries.

Organized by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) in partnership with the University of Groningen (RUG), the University of Nairobi (UoN), and Cheikh Anta Diop University (UCAD), the event brought together climate change, infrastructure and environmental experts, academic researchers, infrastructure and finance specialists from governments, and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) practitioners from Ghana, Kenya, the Netherlands, Senegal, Uganda, and the UK.
