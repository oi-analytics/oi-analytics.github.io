During February 2025, OIA experts visited Jamaica to support the development of a national pipeline of prioritized infrastructure adaptation projects and accompanying financing options. The event marked the culmination of a year-long study that included the development of a new tool for the Government of Jamaica (GoJ): the Jamaica Adaptation Prioritization Tool (J-APT). Alongside the GoJ, the project has been delivered in collaboration with the University of Oxford, the University of the West Indes, the CCCCCs and the UK FCDO.
