In a pioneering new study, researchers from OIA have developed resilience-cost curves for infrastructure systems in the Eastern Caribbean. The study characterised flood, cyclone, and landslide-related risks to energy, water, transport, education, and healthcare assets in Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. For the first time, these marginal cost curves present decision makers with a range of costs to enhance resilience across critical national systems. 

The project was developed in collaboration with the World Bank Latin America and Caribbean regional office, with additional support from government officials.
