OIA experts have produced a novel multi-scale road flood risk assessment for Nigeria. The study included both river and coastal flooding, as well as paved and unpaved roads across the whole country. By quantifying the expected direct assets damages for a variety of future climate scenarios, the analysis revealed unique insights across the national, regional and asset scales to inform decision making for a variety of stakeholders. The analysis has been developed for the World Banks Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) for Nigeria â€“ which is set to be released later in 2025.
