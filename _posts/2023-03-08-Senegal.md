During August 2023, a team of OIA experts delivered a 5-day educational workshop at the Universite Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD), Senegal. The workshop was delivered as part of OIAâ€™s support to the University to undertake Senegal's first national systems-based risk and adpatation assessment for transportation infrastructure.

This novel project will identify a prioritized portfolio of climate adaptation options for national transportation systems, including roads, rail, ports and airports. It is developed in collaboration with the Government of Senegal and the Global Centre on Adaptation (GCA), as part of their Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP).
