New research undertaken by OIA experts has found that infrastructure is a key determinate to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We find that infrastructure either directly or indirectly influences the attainment of all the SDGs, including 72% of the targets. We categorize the positive and negative effects of infrastructure and the interdependencies between infrastructure sectors. To ensure that the right infrastructure is built, policymakers need to establish long-term visions for sustainable national infrastructure systems, informed by the SDGs, and develop adaptable plans that can demonstrably deliver their vision. 

The research was undertaken in collaboration with renowned researchers from the University of Oxford, United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), World Bank Group (WBG), UK Department for International Development (DfID), German Agency for International Corporation (GIZ), and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).
