A new research paper from OIA directors quantifies the benefits of adaptation of electricity substations to flood-related risks. The paper presents novel a methodology to calculate the costs and benefits of adaptation of critical infrastructure systems. This includes a representation of infrastructure geospatial networks at the asset scale, that include physical interdependencies. The methodology is applied electricity substations in England and Wales to demonstrate the large-scale economic benefits of adapting critical assets.
