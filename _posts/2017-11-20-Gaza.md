OIA experts have undertaken the first systematic assessment of infrastructure risk in Gaza. The study harnessed OIA’s capabilities to develop an asset-level geospatial representation of Gaza’s electrical power system and interdependent assets, including from the energy, financial, health, education, water and waste sectors. Using advanced geospatial analysis, the assessment characterised hotspots of critical infrastructure that constitute vulnerabilities to climate-change related hazards. 

Findings from the assessment were presented and discussed with other domain experts at the 2017 Green Growth Knowledge Partnership (GGKP) annual conference. They will feed into an ongoing study between the University of Oxford, United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and the Palestinian Authority that will characterise Palestine’s current and future infrastructure needs.
