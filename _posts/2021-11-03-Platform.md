Modelling and analytics from OIA, developed as part of the World Bank’s Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Program (DRFIP), are driving essential infrastructure developments in Southeast Asia. The pilot phase has just completed in Southeast Asia, with financial and technical support from the Japan-World Bank Program for Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management in Developing Countries.

The pilot study focuses on specific sectors including electricity and transport (road, rail) networks throughout seven Southeast Asia countries (Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos PDR, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand), and on fluvial and coastal flooding and wind hazard (tropical cyclone). The resulting data can be interrogated at sub-national, national or super-national scale.
