Analytics from OIA have revealed new insights to support climate action in Europe and Central Asia. The study quantified water and wastewater sector GHG emissions using novel datasets at the utility scale. Insights from the analysis will be used to target investment prioritisation in the region. 

The project was developed for the World Bank Groupâ€™s water practice, in collaboration with their Europe and central Asia regional office.
