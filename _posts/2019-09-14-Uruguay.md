OIA was in Montevideo during August 2019 to provide training and advisory support to different organisations to
develop an implementable framework for roads risk analysis in Uruguay. The workshop provided evidence of the
beginnings of proactive action needed for long-term climate risks assessment and planning.

The workshop was funded by World Bank, with participants from the Ministry of Transport, Department of Emergency
planning (SINEA), and University of the Republic (UDLEAR).
