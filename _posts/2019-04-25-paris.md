OIA director Scott Thacker highlights the critical role of civil engineers in addressing climate change. The research briefing explores how civil engineers, through their role in planning, delivering, and managing infrastructure systems, are essential for both the mitigation and adaptation targets set out in the Paris Agreement. It provides a description of the major challenges, the required interventions and a call for coordinated action. 

The briefing on sustainability is published in the in the civil engineering journal, Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE).
