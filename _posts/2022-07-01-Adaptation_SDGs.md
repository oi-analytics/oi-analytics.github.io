New research co-developed by OIA experts, demonstrates that, without targeted climate adaptation action across sectors, achievement of all 169 SDG targets is being threatened by the impacts of climate change.

To avoid maladaptive outcomes, the research provides an actionable framework to help more systematically align national adaptation plans with SDG targets. This is particularly important as more countries revise their adaptation commitments under the Paris Agreement.

The research highlights the importance of ecosystems, nature-based adaptation options, and strong governance arrangements as cross-sectoral components of safeguarding sustainable development in the face of climate change impacts.
