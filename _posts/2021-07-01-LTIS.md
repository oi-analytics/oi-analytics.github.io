OIA performed the first flood risk assessment of interdependent infrastructure systems in England, at the asset scale. The assessment used OIA’s unique system-of-systems models to capture direct asset risk and indirect service disruption risks to every building in England and used macroeconomic modelling to calculate losses based on building usage.

The project was developed in collaboration with the Environment Agency and Jacobs as part of the Long-Term Investment Scenarios (LTIS) 2019 update – Developed to optimize flood investment in England.
