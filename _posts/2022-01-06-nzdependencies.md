OIA experts have contributed towards a new research publication that has quantified infrastructure interdependencies in New Zealand. The research, led by Dr Conrad Zorn, developed a methodological framework to measure the systemic relationship between energy and transport systems including using quantitative engineering-based models and expert judgement. The study produced a set of synthetic curves that can be used to estimate dependencies â€“ a key requirement to understand hazard related risks such as earthquakes and typhoons.
