Infrastructure, energy and environment expertise has been further strengthened at the National Infrastructure Commission, as they appoint new Commissioners, one of them being OIA founder and director Prof. Jim Hall. 

The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Helen Whately, said: 
“The National Infrastructure Commission plays an invaluable role providing expert and impartial advice to the government on the UK’s long-term infrastructure challenges. These appointments will ensure we have the right expertise to succeed as we level up opportunities, boost the economy and help create jobs.” 

Chair of the Commission, Sir John Armitt, said: 
“I am pleased to welcome Nick, Kate and Jim to the Commission at a critical time for ensuring long term infrastructure policy helps address some of society’s biggest challenges. Their expertise will be particularly useful as we work towards publication of the second National Infrastructure Assessment next year.” 
Jim will assume his role as NIC Commissioner until April 2027.
