OIA experts expose how climate change will impact Tanzania’s transport systems with knock-on risks for the economy and access to basic services.

UK Aid and World Bank funded the team from OIA to investigate the impact of current and future flooding on the country’s roads, railways,
inland and coastal shipping and aviation networks, that are integral to Tanzania and East African regional connectivity.
The project was developed in collaboration with the Government of The United Republic of Tanzania and provides several
important new lessons for policy makers.
