In collaboration with the water practice of the World Bank Group, OIA experts have developed and piloted a new tool to support climate action in the water sector. The new tool supports the strategic planning of energy components of water and wastewater systems, such as renewable energy, energy efficiencies, and resilience. Key performance metrics are quantified within the tool, including for SDG 6 (water), SDG 7 (energy) and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The tool has been successfully piloted with Manila Water, who provide water services to over 7 million people in metro Manila. Using the tool, Manila water will have new evidence and data to support their latest climate action strategy. It is expected that the tool will be further rolled out to a broad range of countries and contexts over the coming years.
