During the first week of December 2022, a team of OIA experts delivered a 5-day educational workshop at the University of Nairobi, Kenya. The workshop was delivered as part of OIA’s support to the University to undertake Kenya’s first national assessment of climate risk to infrastructure systems to enhance their socio-economic resilience.

The 2-year assessment will identify a prioritized portfolio of evidence-based adaptation options, including nature-based solutions, for the Government of Kenya and is funded by the Global Centre on Adaptation (GCA) as part of their Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP).
