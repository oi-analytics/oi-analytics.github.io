A recent Wall Street Journal video featured OIA Founder and director Dr Raghav Pant.
The video explores the impacts of flooding and extreme weather on transportation
infrastructure, including transit systems such as subways. 

Transit systems from New York City to London and Zhengzhou, China,
have been inundated in recent weeks. Extreme rainfall and flooding are increasing
climate-related risks and costs for underground infrastructure.
