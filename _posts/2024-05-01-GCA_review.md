OIA recently completed a quality and innovation review of infrastructure adaptation assessments for the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA). The review centred on 10 asset-level assessments, from the transport and energy sectors, across different African Countries. OIA expertise was used to highlight where quality and innovation could be further strengthened in future projects.
