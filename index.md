## Climate Risk Analysis for Infrastructure Systems

We provide data, tools, insights and education to accelerate the transition to
sustainable and resilient infrastructure globally.

Grounded in pioneering, peer-reviewed science that has been developed and
demonstrated over the past decade, we are world-leaders in climate risk analysis
for infrastructure systems.

Our unique approach represents the interconnectedness and interdependence of
infrastructure systems, enabling us to more accurately quantify physical climate
risks for a more efficient prioritisation of resources to enhance resilience
through adaptation. 

Our team of experts are committed to supporting evidence-based decision making in
practice to help shape a better future for people and planet. 



<!--
Oxford Infrastructure Analytics (OIA) specializes in analysis of infrastructure
systems and networks, in particular transport, energy and water systems. OIA was
formed by academics at the University of Oxfordâ€™s Environmental Change
Institute, who have been creating novel research on infrastructure network risk
analysis that is recognized worldwide.

OIA provides quantified insights into the resilience of interdependent
infrastructure networks to natural hazard and climate risks, and the potential
economic and social disruption caused by infrastructure failures.

Our work provides the evidence for prioritizing steps to enhance the resilience
of infrastructure systems and to build the business case for a strategic
approach to adaptation.
