Oxford Infrastructure Analytics (OIA) specializes in analysis of infrastructure
systems and networks, in particular transport, energy and water systems. OIA was
formed by academics at the University of Oxfordâ€™s Environmental Change
Institute, who have been creating novel research on infrastructure network risk
analysis that is recognized worldwide.

OIA provides quantified insights into the resilience of interdependent
infrastructure networks to natural hazard and climate risks, and the potential
economic and social disruption caused by infrastructure failures.

Our work provides the evidence for prioritizing steps to enhance the resilience
of infrastructure systems and to build the business case for a strategic
approach to adaptation.
