## Climate Risk Analysis for Infrastructure Systems

Oxford Infrastructure Analytics (OIA) provides data, tools, insights and education
to accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient infrastructure globally. 

Grounded in pioneering, peer-reviewed science that has been developed and
demonstrated over the past decade, we are world-leaders in climate risk analysis
for infrastructure systems.

Our unique approach represents the interconnectedness and interdependence of
infrastructure systems, enabling us to more accurately quantify physical climate
risks and more efficiently prioritise adaptation to enhance resilience.
