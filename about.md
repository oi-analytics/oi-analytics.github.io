## About us

OIA was founded in 2017 by three academics from the award-winning Oxford Programme for Sustainable Infrastructure Systems (OPSIS), based at the University of Oxford. We work with a diverse team of expert associates from around the world to deliver value and excellence to clients on every project.

We are always interested in speaking with like-minded individuals with an interest in infrastructure systems and climate risk analysis. If you think that you would be a good fit at OIA, please get in touch by contacting us <a href="mailto:enquiries@oi-analytics.com">here</a>.
