## Our People

We are an experienced team of professionals with high levels of technical
expertise and a proven track record of delivering solutions to complex problems.
We have a reputation for adding value through innovation and excellence. We are
experts in the analysis of uncertainty, using probabilistic risk analysis as
well as ‘deep uncertainty’ methods, which means that we can identify and test
proportionate and robust adaptation strategies.

We combine cutting edge theoretical expertise derived from one of the world’s
leading research programmes on infrastructure systems, with a pragmatic and
ingenious approach to solving the data challenges that beset infrastructure
systems analysis in most national contexts.

We provide data, models and high-level analytics and are happy to work with
clients to tailor outputs to meet specific needs. We are committed to the long
term use of infrastructure systems analysis in an open source environment.
